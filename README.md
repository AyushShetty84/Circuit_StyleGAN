# Cloning StyleGAN2-ADA for Custom Dataset Training
This project involves training a StyleGAN 2 ADA model on a dataset of PCB circuits images for 10 hours on a Tesla T4 GPU. The goal of this project is to generate high-quality images of PCB circuits using StyleGAN 2 ADA.

## StyleGAN 2 ADA
StyleGAN 2 ADA is a deep learning model that can generate high-quality images with realistic details and textures. It is an improved version of the StyleGAN 2 model, which uses adaptive discriminator augmentation (ADA) to improve the stability and performance of the model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of PCB circuits images collected using Flickr API. The images are preprocessed to ensure that they are of high quality and suitable for training the StyleGAN 2 ADA model.

## Training Procedure
To train the StyleGAN 2 ADA model, I used a Tesla T4 GPU provided by Google Colab and trained the model for 10 hours on the PCB circuits dataset.

## Results
After training the StyleGAN 2 ADA model for 10 hours, although the generated images from my StyleGAN2 model trained on the circuit dataset may not be visually appealing, they do contain recognizable circuit patterns and can be used for further experimentation and development. I have included some sample images generated by the model in the experiments directory.

Following are Images generated from the Model:
